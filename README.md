# tp1ALG2
A python program that implements the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm with the use of a kd-tree. This project was developed for the Algorithms II course at UFMG


The program is meant to be run in a directory that includes a folder named "datasets" which should include the datasets that will be used for training and testing.
The program was developed using KEEL and it is only capable of reading and parsing data that is in the same format as the data found in the KEEL data repository.
